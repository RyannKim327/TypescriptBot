### Setups
> First thing you need is to know the other data, I've created a folder called privates, where all data are privately redirected there, specially the `appstate.json`. So first is you need to create a file named `appstate.json` inside of the privates folder, if the folder doesn't exists just create and name it `privates`. You may also create a file named `credentials.json`, then the content format is:
```JSON
{
	"email": "yourusername",
	"password": "sup3rm@n"
}
```

---
### Shell (Linux) Commands
> To start, you may execute `source run.sh` to your terminal. And choose your commands.

---
### Batch (Windows) Commands
> To start, you may execute `./run.bat` to your terminal. And choose your commands.

---
### Execution
> To execute the program, just run to your terminal `npx nodemon` or `npx ts-node src/index.ts`. The nodemon will automatically refresh if any .js or .ts file change, while the other one needs to terminal the program onced you changed something.
